Different from Toronto, which is an English culturally based city, Montreal is a unique and special city in Canada that is built upon the French culture.\n<br>\n<p>After comparing the big two neighborhoods, this project will also analyze the small neighborhoods inside each city. In the case of Metropolitan Toronto, which is also called the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), contains various neighborhoods. Each neighborhood may have different taste of cuisine so that the suggestions or the opportunities for the restaurant investors may also vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. Same pattern may or may not apply to the city of Montreal, which is worth our investigation. "

This analyzation would provide both the detailed view as well as the whole picture in terms of the restaurant business to the target audience.\nAfter we collect the data, we implement the data cleansing and extract the useful information that is valuable for our target auidence.
